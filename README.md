# pencil

My personal window manager, built using the
[`penrose`](https://github.com/sminez/penrose) library.

## Installation

For creating the binary, just run `make` and it should hopefully be at
`./target/release/pencil`.

If you wish to install it, run `make install`. Note that the binary
will be copied to `~/.local/bin`, not to a global location such as
`/usr/bin`.
